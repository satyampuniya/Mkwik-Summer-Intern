I’m a student from India and i have a deep desire to learn about Digital Marketing.I was earlier volunteering as a marketing manager in a youth run organization called AIESEC in Chennai.Since then i have been intrigued by the subject.I think it will be beneficial for me.I'm studying right now and i have no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this well renowned course. I only get an allowance of 2500 rupees (39$) in which i have to take care of my personal expenses as well.Given my circumstances it is very difficult for meto pay for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without having a negative impact on my allowance.So i reaaly am in need of this financial aid.

I want to complete the Marketing: Customer Needs and Wants Course on offer by IESE Business School. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out Marketing and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.
I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
